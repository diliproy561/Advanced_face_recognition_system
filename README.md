- Stores the **student’s entry time and date**
- Marks attendance automatically
- Sends a **real-time notification to parents**
- Allows parents to monitor whether their child has arrived at the university or not

This system reduces manual attendance errors and provides peace of mind to parents.

## 🔄 System Workflow

1. Student enters the classroom
2. Camera captures the student’s face
3. Face recognition system identifies the student
4. Attendance is marked with **time and date**
5. Data is stored in the database
6. Parent receives an automatic notification
7. Parents can monitor student presence without stress

## 🧠 Use Case Example

- A student enters the classroom at **9:02 AM**
- The system recognizes the student instantly
- Attendance is recorded automatically
- Parent receives a message:
  > “Your child has entered the classroom at 9:02 AM”

This ensures transparency and improves trust between parents and institutions.
